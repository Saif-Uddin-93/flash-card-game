## Installation

For this project, the developer tool We'll be using is VS Code. A lightweight IDE that allows working in JavaScript. It also allows the use of Extensions which can add extra functionality to the tool to help with debugging and making code more readable. The main extension We'll be using is called, Live Server, by Ritwick Dey. The browser that the web page will be used on is Google Chrome and will work on all Chromium-based web browsers.
